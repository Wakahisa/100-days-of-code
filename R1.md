# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I resumed working on my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I do way more reading on concepts and material than I have actually been coding. I know it's better to learn as you code, but the information sponge in me wants to know all about my tools first before diving into projects! A weakness of mine I'm trying to fix through 100 days of code! I put the blog portion of the website back and created image hyperlinks to my social media.

### Day 2: August 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I tried to begin work on a spring application.. and fixed a bug to launch eclipse.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't open eclipse since I updated java.. I went into the eclipse.ini and made a tweak I found on stack overflow to reroute the path variable. It was really late and I didn't have energy to do much.. after the troubleshooting.

### Day 3: August 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Not much.. having a hard time creating a java CRUD application, only generated one using netbeans IDE. This is much more difficult than using .NET for sure.

**Thoughts:** Having trouble finding the proper format to create a CRUD java application with my limited time. I have failed to establish connections with my databases using netbeans and eclipse respectively. I can generate code with netbeans if I have a given database already though.

**Link to work:** None :( I didn't get anything to work properly, bits here and there. 

## Day 4: August 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I created a basic HTML websites with all the tags associated with HTML.

**Thoughts:** Today, I had an interview that opened my perspective and motivated me to solidify my understanding of everything I know and then some, so I can explain it with proper terminology and in layman's terms. I created the HTML project with the intent of being able to tell people, for example, HTML consists of elements such as paragraph, headings, images, videos, etc. that can be further broken down into their components. It was more of a practice exercise for me in explanations + understandings!

**Link to work:** None I don't think it is worth uploading.

## Day 1: August 16, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created a repository for a hotel management system.

**Thoughts:** I figured making a hotel management system would be a good exercise for me. I was inspired by one of the discord servers I frequent, that has a hotel theme to it. The hotel management system would need to be planned out before I can really dive into it, I'm setting up a project board with tasks I'll complete. So far I have only set-up an initial database without creating any additional models or change to the base user. The rest shall come!

## Day 2: August 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went through freecodecamp's HTML5 and CSS tutorials.

**Thoughts:** There was no new information learned for me. I was doing a review and think I should really go straight into the coding projects at the end. I initially learned HTML/CSS just by doing it without really going through tutorials, I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything, but I suppose I'll be fine since I don't necessarily have to memorize everything to make use of it.

**Link to work:** None.

## Day 3: August 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I completed freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design & Applied Accessibility modules.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed working through these modules. The Applied Accessibility module in particular gave me insight on how screenreaders function and showed me how to properly make my webpages accessible to those using one. I really only knew about alt tags and wondered why elements were redundant with the same names. Now I have a better understanding!

**Link to work:** None.

## Day 4: August 19, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the final modules from freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification and began work on my tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I felt I was familiar with most of these concepts already as I had made use of them through bootstrap. Knowing the basic CSS to make use of flexbox and grids will prove useful though in the long run. For my tribute page, I'm considering paying tribute to Megaman-X, a side-scroller game I enjoyed a lot growing up.

**Link to work:** None.

## Day 5: August 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed my tribute page for freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** I changed my tribute topic to Katherine Johnson since I recalled how much I enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. I spent most of my time fact checking after I passed the fcc's test suite. The tribute page itself is pretty barebones, but I felt it got to the point of the matter. I put in the minimal CSS to center align the page. ~~I just realized I created a class for something that already had a class and I named it text-center lol.~~ Nevermind, that's only if I was using bootstrap, which I'm not here.

## Day 6: August 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced with jQuery and went through a react tutorial.

**Thoughts:** jQuery takes CSS and adds interactivity on top of it to deliver a web experience to users. In the same way that I would target an ID or class with CSS, I can change text, create animations, or hide things with jQuery! I've read about react before, but never really dived into it. I can launch a react app, I hope to do something with it one day though! I like how it is readable :) 

**Link to work:** None.
