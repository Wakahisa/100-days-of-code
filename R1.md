# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I resumed working on my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I do way more reading on concepts and material than I have actually been coding. I know it's better to learn as you code, but the information sponge in me wants to know all about my tools first before diving into projects! A weakness of mine I'm trying to fix through 100 days of code! I put the blog portion of the website back and created image hyperlinks to my social media.

### Day 2: August 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I tried to begin work on a spring application.. and fixed a bug to launch eclipse.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't open eclipse since I updated java.. I went into the eclipse.ini and made a tweak I found on stack overflow to reroute the path variable. It was really late and I didn't have energy to do much.. after the troubleshooting.

### Day 3: August 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Not much.. having a hard time creating a java CRUD application, only generated one using netbeans IDE. This is much more difficult than using .NET for sure.

**Thoughts:** Having trouble finding the proper format to create a CRUD java application with my limited time. I have failed to establish connections with my databases using netbeans and eclipse respectively. I can generate code with netbeans if I have a given database already though.

**Link to work:** None :( I didn't get anything to work properly, bits here and there. 

## Day 4: August 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I created a basic HTML websites with all the tags associated with HTML.

**Thoughts:** Today, I had an interview that opened my perspective and motivated me to solidify my understanding of everything I know and then some, so I can explain it with proper terminology and in layman's terms. I created the HTML project with the intent of being able to tell people, for example, HTML consists of elements such as paragraph, headings, images, videos, etc. that can be further broken down into their components. It was more of a practice exercise for me in explanations + understandings!

**Link to work:** None I don't think it is worth uploading.
